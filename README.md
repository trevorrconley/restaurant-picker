restaurants will be weighted based on their most frequent visit
if a restaurant has not been visited in a while, it is supposed to be more likely to be selected
we have a list of restaurants
we have a list of restaurants a user wants to visit
we have a list of histories of when a user visited a restaurant (defaults to now() when visited)
we have a list of users

can we add code to select whether or not we want a sit down/ casual / fast food? (flag in input)
- if no option is given, every restaurant is up for grabs
can we add code to select a specific cuisine? (flag in input)
- or maybe we return just a type of cuisine to have rather than a restaurant if just that wants to be determined (flag in input)
